    "I am a passionate Software Tester having seven plus years of experience in Automation and Manual Testing across various domains, and currently pursuing MSc Computing in University of Northampton. I am always ready to employ automation methodologies to maximize quality assurance and testing quality. I have a proven track record of developing and optimizing the automation frameworks using Selenium that reduced testing time by 50% and improved overall test coverage.  My strong coding background provided me with a very good understanding of software development process which enables me to work well with development teams."+
    "Led peer reviews and provided coaching to team members by promoting best practices in test automation. I have helped my team to build confidence in delivering high quality products to various customers by designing better test strategies. In my previous roles as a team lead, I always took the approach to ensure that every team member is actively engaged and contributing their skills and ideas to the project. I am currently seeking a job as a Software Tester and I am eager to leverage both industry experience and ongoing academic pursuits to drive innovation and excellence in software testing and development"
